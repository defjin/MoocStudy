## 1 What is Computation?

### Goal of Course

- PROBLEM SOLVING
- KNOWLEDGE OF CONCEPTS
- PROGRAMMING SKILL

### Topics

- represent knowledge with data structures
- iteration and recursion as computational metaphors
- abstraction of procedures and data types
- organize and modularize systems using object classes and methods
- different classes of algorithms, searching and sorting 
- complexity of algorithms



`good code, good style, readable code - because of collaboration`

`how to know better algorithms? better program? `

 

### What does a computer do? 

- `Calculations` (built-in : something like + , - ,/ , * , define own calculation)
- `Remembers`



### Types of knowledge

- `declarative knowledge` is statements of fact
- `imperative knowledge` is a recipe or 'how-to'



### What is a recipe?

1) sequence of simple steps

2) flow of control process 

3) a means of determining when to stop



### Creating Recipes

- a programming language provides a set of primitive operations
- expressions are complex but legal combinations of primitives
- expressions and computations have values and meanings



### Aspects of language

- `Syntax` 

|                       | Not Valid   | Valid        |
| --------------------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| English               | cat dog boy | cat hugs boy |
| Programming  Language | "hi"5       | 3.2 *5       |

- `static semantics `: which syntactically valid string have meaning

|                      |                       |                                                      |
| -------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| English              | I are hungry          | -> syntactically valid but statics semantic error    |
| Programming Language | 3.2 * 5 <br />3+ 'hi' | -> syntactically valid<br />-> static semantic error |

- `semantics` : the meaning associated with a syntactically correct string of symbols with no static semantic errors

|                      |                                  |                                                              |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| English              | "Flying planes can be dangerous" | can have many meanings ( syntactically valid & static semantic correct) |
| Programming Language |                                  | have only one meaning but may not be what programmer intended |



### Where things go wrong!

- syntactic errors 
  - common and easily caught
- static semantic errors
  - some languages check for there before running program
  - can cause unpredictable behavior
- no semantic errors but different meaning that what programmer intended
  - program crashes, stops running
  - program runs forever
  - program gives an answer but different than expected



### Python Programs

- a program is a sequence of definitions and commands
  - definitions evaluated
  - commands executed by Python interpreter in a shell
- commands (statements) instruct interpreter to do something
- can be typed directly in a shell or stored in a file that is read into the shell and evaluated



### Object

- programs manipulate data objects
  - scalar(can't be subdivided)  - ex) 5
  - non scalar (have internal structure that can be accessed)  ex) [1,2,3,4,5]

``` python
# Scalar
# int - represent integers : ex) 5
# float - represent real numbers : ex) 3.2
# bool - represent Boolean values : True or False
# NoneType : None
#
# can use type() to see type of an object
# type(5) : int
# tpye(3.0) : float
```



### Type Conversions(Cast)

- can convert object of one type to another

``` python
# int(3.9) = 3
# float(3) = 3.0 
# str(3) = '3'
# int('3') = 3
```



### Printing to Console

```python
print(3) 
```

in anaconda or jupyter notebook or shell -> theirs output is not actual output. 

if you want to out to console use `print()`

"out" tells you it's an interaction within the shell only

No "out" means it is actually shown to a user, apparent when you edit/run files

```python
# in shell
# In [90] : 3+2 
# out [91] : 5  # <- this is not actual output 
# In [92] : print(3+2)
# 5  # <- actual output
```



### Expressions

- combine objects and operators to form expressions
- an expression has a value, which has a type
- syntax for a simple expression

```python
<object> <operator> <object>
i+j , i-j , i*j , i/j 
i % j, i ** j 
```



### Binding Variables and Values

- `equal sign` is an `assignment` of a value to a variable name

```python
 ex) pi = 3.1415 # <variable> = <value>
```

- value stored in computer memory
- an assignment binds name to value
- retrieve value associated with name or variable by invoking the name, by typing pi



### Abstracting Expressions

- why give names to values of expressions? 
- to reuse names instead of values
- easier th change code later

```python
pi = 3.14
radius = 2
area = pi (radius ** 2) # the area of circle = pi * radius * radius
```



### Programming  vs. Math

- in programming, you do not 'solve for x'
- the '=' means not same, but assignment

```python
radius = 2
radius = radius + 1 # in math : cannot solve this equation
radius += 1
# but in programming 
# expression on the right, evaluated to a value
# variable name on the left

# so , first evaluated value of right side : 2+1 = 3 
# and then, assignment this value to left side: raduis = 3
# now radius's value is 3
```



### Changing Bindings

- can re-bind variable names using new assignment statements

- previous value may still stored in memory but lost the handle for it

  (something do like pointer - using python tutor very easy to understand

- value for variable does not change until you tell the computer to do the calculation again
